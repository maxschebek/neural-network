# Neural network with backpropagation

This repo contains an implemenation of a neural network utilizing linear algebra routines provided by [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html). The implementation follows Andrew Ng's [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Details on the implemenation can be found in the [documentation](documentation/neural_network.pdf).
